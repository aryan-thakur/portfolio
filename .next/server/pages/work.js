The Azure training was integral to the work that would soon follow. After my trainings concluded, around the second month of my term with the company, I was introduced to my 5-person team and told that I would be working on developing a new KPMG product. The product I was going to develop was an MSS SIEM (Managed Security Systems, Security Information & Event Management) and the main portion of this development would be dev-ops heavy on the Microsoft Azure Platform. I began work I had never previously done, I began provisioning Virtual Machines installing services, linking machines together, configuring and sending logs from firewalls to these machines and so on. There was a lot of interesting and crucial work and I had accessible help every step of the way, whenever I needed it. Towards the end of my term I was designated scripting work in Python, which is something I have always been familiar with and executed the scripting to perfection. Every task I complete had to be documented, and creating documentation files around tasks and code made up a great chunk of my term at KPMG as well."},{"company":"Royal Bank of Canada","position":"Cyber Security Analyst","range":"Jan 2022 - Apr 2022","desc":"Being in the Cyber Security branch of RBC, every team and individual aimed to improve the enterprise’s security with their products, services and projects. I worked on the Firewall Rule Accreditation Project, that aimed to clean up unused firewall rules in the RBC firewall policies, to basically tie up loose ends and therefore tighten security based on the Principle of Least Privelege. I recieved change requests, and edited the firewall rules of vendors such as Palo Alto and Check Point. Other times, I verified if the changes were made by properly by automation scripts. Another part of my work at the firm was Risk Assessment. The way this worked was fairly simple: a lot of data and metadata was collected for new rule requests from the rule requesters. Through automation scripts data was fetched from internal RBC data platforms about the risk and validity of this possible new rule. Using these results and analyzing the rule myself, through security training and research I made an informed decision on whether to accept this rule and create it in the firewalls or request for a re-submission."},{"company":"University of Toronto","position":"Lead Teaching Assistant","range":"Jan 2022 - present","desc":"I have been appointed as the Lead TA for the Operating Systems (CSCC69) course multiple times.
